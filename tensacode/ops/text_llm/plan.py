    Generate a plan based on the provided prompt using LLM-based methods.

    This implementation uses the engine's language model to generate a structured plan

        engine (Engine): The engine used for planning.
        prompt (Optional[Encoded[str]], optional): A prompt to guide the planning process.
        **kwargs: Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the engine.
